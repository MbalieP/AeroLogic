## 📌 Overview
**AeroLogic** is a full-stack web application built with **Django** that demonstrates key backend development principles.  
It manages a relational database of airports and flights, highlighting a clean implementation of the **Model–View–Template (MVT)** architecture.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Comprehensive Data Models** – Define `Airport` and `Flight` entities with appropriate fields and relationships.  
- **Relational Database Design** – Implements one-to-many relationships via Django’s `ForeignKey`, linking flights to their origin and destination airports.  
- **Django ORM Proficiency** – Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Django ORM without raw SQL.  
- **Database Migrations** – Manage schema evolution with Django’s built-in migration system.  
- **Dynamic Templates** – Render data to HTML using Django’s templating engine.  
- **Shell Interaction** – Create and query data directly from the Django shell.

## 🗃️ Database Schema

### Airport Model
- `code` *(CharField)* – The 3-letter IATA code (e.g., `JFK`).  
- `city` *(CharField)* – The city where the airport is located.  

### Flight Model
- `origin` *(ForeignKey → Airport)* – Departure airport (`related_name="departures"`).  
- `destination` *(ForeignKey → Airport)* – Arrival airport (`related_name="arrivals"`).  
- `duration` *(IntegerField)* – Duration of the flight in minutes.  

This schema allows for powerful queries, such as retrieving all flights departing from a specific airport.
